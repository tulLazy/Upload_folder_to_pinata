# Upload_folder_to_pinata
Uploading a folder (containing metadata or whatever you'd like) to pinata

I was looking for a complete python_brownie script to upload a folder to pinata but i couldn't find it...
Thanks to some stackoverflow question and answers i was able to make the ultimate script that worked for me.
Read the description on top of the upload_to_pinata.py file, it might help!
